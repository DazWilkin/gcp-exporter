# Prometheus Exporter for [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) resources

I want to be able to monitor my resource consumption across multiple cloud platforms (GCP, Digital Ocean and Linode). I was inspired by [@metalmatze](https://github.com/metalmatze)'s [DigitalOcean Exporter](https://github.com/metalmatze/digitalocean_exporter) and, with this exporter, have the three that I need:

+ [Google Cloud Platform Exporter](https://github.com/DazWilkin/gcp-exporter)
+ [Digital Ocean Exporter](https://github.com/metalmatze/digitalocean_exporter)
+ [Linode Exporter](https://github.com/DazWilkin/linode-exporter)
